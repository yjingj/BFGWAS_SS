Bayesian Functional Genome-wide Association Study (BFGWAS)
=======
This updated version **BFGWAS** implements a more efficient computation algorithm to save upto 90\% computation time and upto 50\% memory usage, compared to the initial released version in 2017. In particular, this **BFGWAS** version first compute single variant score statistics (GWAS summary statistics) and LD correlation files from individual-level GWAS data, and then load

BFGWAS_SS uses a new annotation file format: CHR POS REF ALT FUNC
